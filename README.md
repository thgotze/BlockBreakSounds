4. Globally disable pitch variance

2. Add a "Randomize!" button that randomly picks a sound from all the sounds in the game

2. Blacklist blocks to not play sound if broken block is blacklisted
3. Assign differing sounds to differing blocks 
4. Assign differing sounds to differing tools

then you can choose the values of the crest and trough
7. Option to disable pitch variance
